# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 30, 2018


**Today's Progress**: Forked 100-days-of-code repo, read rules.

**Thoughts:** I didn't realize tutorial work doesn't count for days of coding. That's okay. I'll figure something out to build off my tutorial work to later do "real coding" for an hour each day.
