# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 30, 2018


**Today's Progress**: Forked 100-days-of-code repo, read rules.

**Thoughts:** I didn't realize tutorial work doesn't count for days of coding. That's okay. I'll figure something out for using my tutorial work to do "real coding" for an hour each day.
