# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0.5: December 31, 2018


**Today's Progress**: Picked "Python Projects" book as my workbook to start this #100daysofcode tomorrow. Bonus: My company published this book! http://www.wrox.com/WileyCDA/WroxTitle/Python-Projects.productCd-111890866X.html

**Thoughts:** Looking forward to starting my first #100daysofcode tomorrow.




### Day 0: December 30, 2018


**Today's Progress**: Forked 100-days-of-code repo, read rules.

**Thoughts:** I didn't realize tutorial work doesn't count for days of coding. That's okay. I'll figure something out to build off my tutorial work to later do "real coding" for an hour each day.
